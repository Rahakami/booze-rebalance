# booze-rebalance
A minor mod for Sailwind that changes the alcohol effects

This mod requires the Sailwind Mod Manager to be installed. 
It uses Harmony and is compatible with other mods.

Most of the files here are auto-generated by Visual Studio. To create this, I mainly followed [this tutorial](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/How_to_create_mod_for_unity_game), but I used Net Framework 4.6.1 after finding some issues with 4.0

The actual coding for this mod takes place in [this file](https://github.com/Rahakami/booze-rebalance/blob/master/BoozeRebalance/BoozeRebalance.cs), use it as a reference for your own mod.
